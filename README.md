# rsfMRI-CBF prediction

This reprepository has the codes for CBF prediction and statistical analysis in the paper *Predicting cerebral blood flow using voxel-wise resting-state functional MRI*. 

- `power_run.m` extracts the power after Fourier transform in resting state fMRI (rsfMRI) data.
- `sp_feature.R` calculates the power-spectral features for sepcific frequency bands.
- `pred_run.R` predicts cerebral blood flow(CBF) using Support Vector Machine (SVM) models.
